<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am insatiably curious learner, studying both computer science and psychology. Computer science is a source of novel problems to study and solve, and an outlet for creativity. Psychology strives to answer many questions about our human experience and teaches the scientific framework for asking new ones. </p>
<p>I am a engaged teacher and an experienced leader. I've taught sailing for the last 3 years to students of all ages and trained two programming successors at the <a href="goldsmithltwins.waisman.wisc.edu">Goldsmith Lab</a>. In the Boy Scouts, I lead a troop of over 50 scouts for a year.</p>
<p>I am a supportive team player. I played on a football team with Madison comminuty members with cognitive disabilities and volunteered at a food shelf, ensuring everyone gets the food they need</p>
